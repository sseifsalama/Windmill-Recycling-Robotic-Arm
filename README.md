# Robotic Arm

A fully functional robotic arm controlled remotely using custom-made muscle and eye sensors as well as additional sensors. The basis of this project was combining an Engineering design module to design a robotic arm and an electronic systems module to design and implement a custom-made muscle sensor to move servo motors.

## Step by Step Implementation

1. 3D print Robotic Arm Parts and assemble (Refer to tobecreated.md)
2. Buy and assemble circuit components (Refer to tobecreated.md)
3. Upload code to microcontoller (Refer to tobecreated.md)

## Applications

As a low cost robotic arm with a customizable end-effector, it can have a wide range of applications:
1. Usuage in dangerous situations
2. Usuage in circumstances where cost is a factor
3. Usuage in circumstances requiring precision
4. Usuage in circumstances requiring manual hand control
