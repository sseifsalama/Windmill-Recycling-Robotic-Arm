# Robotic Arm

A fully functional robotic arm, which cuts wind turbine steel, and paints it with a protective coating. Althogh customizable, it is equiped with two end effectors:
1. Fly Cutter rotated using bevel gears
2. Paint Brush rotated using pan and tilt mehcnaism

## Step by Step Prototype Implementation

1. 3D print Robotic Arm Parts
2. Buy and connect electrical components
3. Upload main.ino to microcontoller

## Applications

As a low cost robotic arm with a customizable end-effector, it can have a wide range of applications:
1. Usuage in dangerous situations
2. Usuage in circumstances where cost is a factor
3. Usuage in circumstances requiring precision
4. Usuage in circumstances requiring manual hand control
